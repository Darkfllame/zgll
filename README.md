# Zig openGL Loader
Simple opengl loader, entirely written in Zig. All functions are under `zgll.GL`, all constants and function got their prefix removed (`GL_` and `gl`) for easier typing. Don't expect much updates, might do extension loader soon...

## Beware though
This library was mostly made in a night, so expect typos, incoherent names and more...
